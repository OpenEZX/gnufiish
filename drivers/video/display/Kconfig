	  This framework adds support for low-level control of a display.
	  This includes support for power.

	  Enable this to be able to choose the drivers for controlling the
	  physical display panel/monitor on some platforms. This not only
	  covers LCD displays for PDAs but also other types of displays
	  such as CRT, TVout etc.

	  To have support for your specific display panel you will have to
	  select the proper drivers which depend on this option.

	  SPI driver for the control interface of TFT panels containing
	  the TPO JBT6K74-AS controller ASIC, such as the TPO TD028TTEC1
	  TFT diplay module used in the FIC/Openmoko Neo1973 GSM phones.

	  The control interface is required for display operation, as it
	  controls power management, display timing and gamma calibration.
