/*
 * this defines the struct which is used to communicate between the FIQ
 * world and the normal linux kernel world.  One of these structs is
 * statically defined for you in the monolithic kernel so the FIQ ISR code
 * can safely touch it any any time.
 *
 * You also want to include this file in your kernel module that wants to
 * communicate with your FIQ code.  Add any kinds of vars that are used by
 * the FIQ ISR and the module in here.
 *
 * To get you started there is just an int that is incremented every FIQ
 * you can remove this when you are ready to customize, but it is useful
 * for testing
